## What is Django?

Django is a high-level Python web framework that simplifies the development of web applications. It handles many of the complexities of web development, allowing developers to focus on writing their applications.

Django promotes the reusability of components, adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. It comes with built-in features like authentication, database connections, and CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), making it particularly useful for database-driven websites.

## How does Django Work?

Django follows the MVT (Model View Template) design pattern:

- **Model**: Represents the data and the business logic, usually tied to a database.
- **View**: Handles user requests and returns the appropriate response, often rendering a template.
- **Template**: Defines the presentation layer, usually HTML, with placeholders for dynamic data.

## Model

The model layer interacts with the database using Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system. This ORM allows developers to work with databases using Python code instead of complex SQL queries.

Models are defined in a file called `models.py` and provide an abstraction over the database structure.

## View

A view in Django is a function or method that processes HTTP requests, retrieves data from models, and passes this data to a template. Views are typically defined in a file called `views.py`.

---

## Template

Templates define the structure and layout of web pages. They are usually HTML files with Django template tags that include logic for displaying dynamic data.

Templates are stored in a directory named `templates`.

Example of a template:

```django
<h1>My Homepage</h1>
<p>My name is {{ firstname }}.</p>
```

## URLs

Django uses URL routing to navigate between different pages. When a URL is requested, Django determines which view to call based on the URL patterns defined in `urls.py`.

---

## Workflow Summary

When a user requests a URL in a Django web application, the following steps occur:

1. Django receives the URL and checks the `urls.py` file to find the corresponding view.
2. The view function, defined in `views.py`, processes the request.
3. The view interacts with the model(s) to retrieve or manipulate data.
4. The view sends the data to a template.
5. The template generates the final HTML content and returns it to the browser.

This process illustrates the basic workflow of a Django application.

## Django History

Django was created by the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper in 2003 to meet tight deadlines and handle the needs of experienced web developers. It was first released to the public in July 2005. The latest version of Django is 4.0.3 (released in March 2022).
