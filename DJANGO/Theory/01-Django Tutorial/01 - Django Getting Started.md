Here's an improved and visually enhanced version of your Django installation notes:

---

# Installing Django

To install Django, you need to have [Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) and a package manager like [PIP](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_pip.asp) installed on your system. PIP comes bundled with Python versions 3.4 and above.

## Checking Python Installation

First, ensure that Python is installed on your system. Open your command prompt (or terminal) and run the following command:

```bash
python --version
```

If Python is installed, you will see the version number, such as:

```bash
Python 3.9.1
```

If Python is not installed, you can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).

## Checking PIP Installation

Next, check if PIP is installed by running the following command in your command prompt:

```bash
pip --version
```

If PIP is installed, you will see a result similar to:

```bash
pip 20.2.3 from c:\\python39\\lib\\site-packages\\pip (python 3.9)
```

If PIP is not installed, you can download and install it from the [PIP project page](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).
