## Install Django

Now, that we have created a virtual environment, we are ready to install Django.

**Note:** Remember to install Django while you are in the virtual environment!

Django is installed using pip, with this command:


```Windows:

py -m pip install Django
```

```Unix/MacOS:

python -m pip install Django
```

## Windows, Mac, or Unix?

You can run this project on either one. There are some small differences, like when writing commands in the command prompt, Windows uses `py` as the first word in the command line, while Unix and MacOS use `python`:

py --version

```Unix/MacOS:

python --version
