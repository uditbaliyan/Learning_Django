## What is an App?

An app is a web application that has a specific meaning in your project, like a home page, a contact form, or a members database.

In this tutorial we will create an app that allows us to list and register members in a database.

But first, let's just create a simple Django app that displays "Hello World!".

___

## Create App

I will name my app `members`.

Start by navigating to the selected location where you want to store the app, in my case the `my_tennis_club` folder, and run the command below.

If the server is still running, and you are not able to write commands, press \[CTRL\] \[BREAK\], or \[CTRL\] \[C\] to stop the server and you should be back in the virtual environment.
```
py manage.py startapp members
```
Django creates a folder named `members` in my project, with this content:
```
my\_tennis\_club  
    manage.py  
    my\_tennis\_club/  
    members/  
        migrations/  
            \_\_init\_\_.py  
        \_\_init\_\_.py  
        admin.py  
        apps.py  
        models.py  
        tests.py  
        views.py  
```
These are all files and folders with a specific meaning. You will learn about most of them later in this tutorial.

First, take a look at the file called `views.py`.

This is where we gather the information we need to send back a proper response.

You will learn more about views in the [next chapter](https://www.w3schools.com/django/django_views.php).
