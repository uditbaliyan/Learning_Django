## Details Template

The next step in our web page will be to add a Details page, where we can list more details about a specific member.

Start by creating a new template called `details.html`:

`my_tennis_club/members/templates/details.html`:

```django
<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html> 
	<body> 
		<h1>{{ mymember.firstname }} {{ mymember.lastname }}</h1> 
		<p>Phone: {{ mymember.phone }}</p> 
		<p>Member since: {{ mymember.joined_date }}</p> 
		<p>Back to <a href="/members">Members</a></p> 
	</body> 
</html>
```

## Add Link in all-members Template

The list in `all_members.html` should be clickable, and take you to the details page with the ID of the member you clicked on:

`my_tennis_club/members/templates/all_members.html`:

```django
<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html> 
	<body> 
		<h1>Members</h1> 
		<ul> 
		{% for x in mymembers %} 
		<li>
		<a href="details/{{ x.id }}">{{ x.firstname }} {{ x.lastname }}</a>
		</li> {% endfor %} 
		</ul> 
	</body> 
</html>
```

## Create new View

Then create a new view in the `views.py` file, that will deal with incoming requests to the `/details/` url:

`my_tennis_club/members/views.py`:

```jsx
from django.http import HttpResponse 
from django.template import loader 
from .models import Member 
def members(request):
	mymembers = Member.objects.all().values()
	template = loader.get_template('all_members.html')
	context = { 'mymembers': mymembers, } 
	return HttpResponse(template.render(context, request)) 
def details(request, id):
	mymember = Member.objects.get(id=id)
	template = loader.get_template('details.html')
	context = { 'mymember': mymember, }
	return HttpResponse(template.render(context, request))
```

The `details` view does the following:

-   Gets the `id` as an argument.
-   Uses the `id` to locate the correct record in the Member table.
-   loads the `details.html` template.
-   Creates an object containing the member.
-   Sends the object to the template.
-   Outputs the HTML that is rendered by the template.

## Add URLs

Now we need to make sure that the `/details/` url points to the correct view, with `id` as a parameter.

Open the `urls.py` file and add the details view to the `urlpatterns` list:

`my_tennis_club/members/urls.py`:

```jsx
from django.urls import path 
from . import views 
urlpatterns = [ 
path('members/', views.members, name='members'), path('members/details/<int:id>', views.details, name='details'), ]
```

If you have followed all the steps on your own computer, you can see the result in your own browser: `[127.0.0.1:8000/members/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/members/)`.

If the server is down, you have to start it again with the `runserver` command:
